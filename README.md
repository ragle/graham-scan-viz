###About

A simple command line app written in Ruby to help visualize the [Graham Scan algorithm](http://geomalgorithms.com/a10-_hull-1.html#Graham-Scan) for finding the [convex hull](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConvexHull.html) of an object in an ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup> euclidean space. This was an assignment in my undergrad algorithm analysis course.

I wrote this last year. I had been meaning to teach myself Ruby, and this was my very first project with the language. This will be immediately obvious if you read the code (do yourself a favor: don't). The value here for others is in running the app and using the visualization to help "see" how the algorithm works - not in the implementation of the algorithm itself.    

For detailed information about Graham's scan and its geometric underpinnings, chapter 33 of [CLRS](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) provides a thorough treatment.

###Usage

```
NAME
    main.rb -

```

###Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ragle/graham-scan-viz.git

$ cd graham-scan-viz

$ gem install escort ap 

```

[Install Ruby/TK](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html). I'm sorry.


###To do

*  Write GAL to remove tcl/TK as a strict dependency, allow for something like shoes or any other library / gem that is easy to install
*  Create issues for bad code / sloppy decisions. Fix them.
*  Write an explanatory blog post about Graham's scan and convex hulls in general

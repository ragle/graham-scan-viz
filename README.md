###About

A command line app written in Ruby to help visualize the [Graham Scan algorithm](http://geomalgorithms.com/a10-_hull-1.html#Graham-Scan) for finding the [convex hull](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConvexHull.html) of an object in an ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup> euclidean space. This was an assignment in my undergrad algorithm analysis course.

This was the first application I've written in Ruby, which will likely be obvious if you are at all familiar with the language. ;) Feedback from experienced Rubyists would be welcomed and appreciated!

For more detailed information about Graham's scan and its geometric underpinnings, chapter 33 of [CLRS](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) provides a thorough treatment.

###Usage

```
NAME
    main.rb -                                                                                                                                                                                                       

    A simple app to help visualize the Graham Scan algorithm for finding convex hulls.

```

###Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ragle/graham-scan-viz.git

$ cd graham-scan-viz

$ gem install escort ap 

```

[Install Ruby/TK](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html). I'm sorry.


###To do

*  Write GAL to remove tcl/TK as a strict dependency, allow for something like shoes or any other library / gem that is easy to install
*  Create issues for bad code / sloppy decisions. Fix them.
*  Write an explanatory blog post about Graham's scan and convex hulls in general
